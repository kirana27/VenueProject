                                    <p>"It's funny because when they knew about my inline career, people would say 'Oh, we'll see you in the Olympics one day', and I'd be like, 'No, my sport's not in the Olympics and I'll never be an ice skater'. I never really imagined switching over to ice just because I loved inline so much and I hated being cold." - Erin Jackson</p>
                                    <p>"I feel that the expectations people have of me are bigger than those I put on myself. I try to maintain my rhythm while not feeling too much pressure. I also think it’s important that I find solutions to the challenges I face one by one." - Kagiyama Yuma</p>
